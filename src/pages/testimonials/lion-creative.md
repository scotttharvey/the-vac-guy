> It is rare in the high-priced/quick sale world that we find someone who not only loves what they do - they love what they sell.  Jim was EXCEPTIONAL in every sense of the word when selling and installing our central vac.  He carefully answered all of the ridiculous questions I had, came over to my home 3 times to make sure everything was perfect, presented multiple products for purchase and then carefully explained the merits of each.  Without hesitation, I would recommend THEVACGUY to ANYONE and EVERYONE.  I am not only thrilled with our investment, I feel fortunate to have worked with Jim.
