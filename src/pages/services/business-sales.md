In most situations we only install the rugged electrified Hayden Super Valves, unlike many low cost installations that require a cumbersome power cord attached to the vacuum hose to run the electric power head. The Full Face Super Valves are also the most aesthetic of all valves and come in white, ivory, black, chocolate, and almond. 

Our installations provide the right amount of outlets for your cleaning convenience. The best time to install a vacuum system is during new construction but it is possible to install a system in an existing home. TheVACguy installs ASTM standard central vacuum pipe and fittings using best practices installation methods for peak efficiency of the system.
