> This is the best vacuum service company I have dealt with. They installed three outlets for our central vac system in our unfinished basement and did a fantastic job for a very reasonable price. Later I had a short in my power head and/or hose, which again was handled in a professional manner.  Jim Harvey, the President of the company, personally called me to make sure I was satisfied with the work of his crew.  I give these guys five stars and recommend them to anybody who needs installation, parts, service, etc...
